# Readability Score

**Readability Score** is a Java console application that analyzes a given text and calculates various readability indices:

- **ARI** (Automated Readability Index)
- **FK** (Flesch–Kincaid Readability Test)
- **SMOG** (Simple Measure of Gobbledygook)
- **CL** (Coleman–Liau Index)

Each index estimates the age (in years) of a person who should be able to understand the text.
